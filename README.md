# my-media-list
My First Android/Kotlin project that holds the list of finished movies and their description. Educational purposes mostly. It uses MVVM design pattern, Room databaste, Retrofit for calling TMDB Api and Glide for image covers loading. 
# TODO
* Statistics (all, period)
* Divide main list by months
